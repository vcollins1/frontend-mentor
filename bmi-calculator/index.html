      Better understand your weight in relation to your height using our 
      body mass index (BM) calculator. While BMI is not the sole determinant

    <h2>What your BMI result means</h2>
    <img src="./assets//images/image-man-eating.webp" alt="man eating sushi with chopsticks">
    <p>
      A BMI range of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered a 'healthy weight.' Maintaining a 
      healthy weight may lower your chances of experiencing health issues later on, 
      such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Aim for a nutritious diet with reduced 
      fat and sugar content, incorporating ample fruits and vegetables. Additionally, 
      strive for regular physical activity, ideally about 30 minutes daily for 
      five days a week.

      <h2>Limitations of BMI</h2>
      <p>
        Although BMI is often a practical indicator of healthy weight, it is not suited for 
        every person. Specific groups should carefully consider their BMI outcomes, and in 
        certain cases, the measurement may not be beneficial to use.

      <h3>Gender</h3>
      <p>
        The development and body fat composition of girls and boys vary with age. Consequently, 
        a child's age and gender are considered when evaluating their BMI.

      <h3>Age</h3>
      <p>
        In aging individuals, increased body fat and muscle loss may cause BMI to underestimate 
        body fat content.

      <img src="./assets/images/icon-gender.svg" alt="">
      <h3>Muscle</h3>
      <p>
        BMI may misclassify muscular individuals as overweight or obese, as it doesn't 
        differentiate muscle from fat.

      <h3>Pregnancy</h3>
      <p>
        Expectant mothers experience weight gain due to their growing baby. Maintaining a 
        healthy pre-pregnancy BMI is advisable to minimise health risks for both mother 
        and child.

      <p>
        Certain health concerns may affect individuals of some Black and Asian origins at 
        lower BMIs than others. To learn more, it is advised to discuss this with your 
        GP or practice nurse.
